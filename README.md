# Analysing-global-semiconductor-shortage
A variety of factors have converged to make the coveted computer chips scarce. Soaring demand coupled with supply bottlenecks have led to a situation in which orders for everything from cars to televisions to touch-screen computers and more are on backup for six months or more. The market for semiconductors has been volatile in the last 2 years and experts predict supply chain challenges across the semiconductor industry will extend to late 2023 and early 2024. 

In this statistical analysis, we will analyse the current semiconductor market scenario from a financial perspective using various statistical tools. This analysis is done using a secondary dataset named “Semiconductor shortage” provided by kaggle. The dataset carries semiconductor market data from 1985 to 2021.

THE DATASET HAS 10 COLUMNS Each one is as follows
Date: given in dd/mm/yy format.
Producer Price Index(By Industry in $): It is a group of indexes that calculates and represents the average movement in selling prices from domestic production over time.
Import and Export Price Index: measure the change in prices of goods and services purchased from abroad by U.S. consumers and businesses (imports) and sold to foreign buyers 
No. of employed peoples in the semiconductor industry: employment indicator.
Export Price Index (End-use excluding without semiconductors): measure the change in prices of goods and services purchased from abroad by U.S. consumers and businesses (imports) and sold to foreign buyers but without including semiconductor.
Relative Importance Weights : (Contribution to the Total Industrial Production Index % WISE)
Import Price Index(End Use): Capital Goods, Excluding Computers, Peripherals, and Semiconductors.
Export Price Index(End Use): Capital Goods, Excluding Computers, Peripherals, and Semiconductors
Industrial Production: Non-Energy Excluding Motor Vehicles & Parts, Computers, Communications Equipment, and Semiconductors
Intel share price: Maximum share price of Intel each year
